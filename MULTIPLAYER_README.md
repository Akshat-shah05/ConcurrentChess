# Multiplayer Chess - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The multiplayer functionality has been completely implemented with the following features:

### Backend Features
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication using FastAPI WebSocket
- **Game Management**: Create, join, and manage multiple concurrent games
- **Player Assignment**: Automatic color assignment (white/black)
- **Turn Validation**: Ensures players can only move on their turn
- **Game State Synchronization**: Real-time board state updates
- **Disconnection Handling**: Graceful cleanup when players disconnect

### Frontend Features
- **Game Lobby**: Browse and join available games
- **Game Creation**: Create new games with unique IDs
- **Real-time Updates**: Live board updates and turn indicators
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for connection state
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## How to Use

### Starting the Servers

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python websocket_server.py
   ```
   The WebSocket server will run on `ws://localhost:8766`

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Playing Multiplayer

1. **Navigate to Multiplayer**: Click "Multiplayer" on the home page
2. **Create or Join a Game**:
   - **Create Game**: Click "Create Game" to start a new game
   - **Join Game**: Browse available games and click "Join"
3. **Wait for Opponent**: The game will start when both players join
4. **Play Chess**: Make moves on your turn, watch opponent moves in real-time

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### WebSocket Server (`websocket_server.py`)
- **Game Management**: Uses dictionaries to track active games, connections, and player assignments
- **Message Handling**: Processes different message types (create_game, join, move, etc.)
- **Broadcasting**: Sends updates to all players in a game
- **Error Handling**: Validates moves and provides meaningful error messages

#### Key Data Structures
```python
_active_games: Dict[str, Board]  # game_id -> Board
connections: Dict[str, Set[WebSocket]]  # game_id -> set of WebSocket
player_colors: Dict[WebSocket, str]  # WebSocket -> color
game_players: Dict[str, Dict[str, WebSocket]]  # game_id -> {color: websocket}
available_games: Dict[str, Dict]  # game_id -> game info
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### WebSocket Service (`websocket.ts`)
- **Connection Management**: Handles WebSocket connection and reconnection
- **Message Handling**: Processes server messages and updates UI state
- **Game State**: Tracks current game ID and player color

#### Multiplayer Component (`MultiplayerGame.tsx`)
- **State Management**: Manages game state, player color, connection status
- **UI States**: Lobby, waiting, and game play screens
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates board and UI based on WebSocket messages

### Message Protocol

#### Client to Server Messages
- `create_game`: Create a new game
- `get_games`: Request list of available games
- `join`: Join a specific game with game_id
- `move`: Make a chess move
- `board_state`: Request current board state
- `legal_moves`: Request legal moves for current position

#### Server to Client Messages
- `game_created`: Confirmation of game creation with game_id
- `game_list`: List of available games
- `player_assignment`: Player color assignment
- `player_joined`: Notification when opponent joins
- `game_started`: Game is ready to play
- `board_state`: Current board state
- `game_result`: Game end result
- `error`: Error messages

## Features

### âœ… Implemented

3. **Real-time Updates**: Live board updates across all players
4. **Turn Management**: Only current player can make moves
5. **Connection Resilience**: Automatic reconnection and error handling
6. **Clean UI**: Intuitive interface with status indicators

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to multiplayer in both
3. Create a game in one window
4. Join the game in the other window
5. Play chess moves and verify synchronization

### Automated Testing
Run the test script to verify WebSocket functionality:
```bash
cd backend
python test_websocket.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**: Ensure backend server is running on port 8766
2. **Games Not Showing**: Check if WebSocket connection is established
3. **Moves Not Working**: Verify it's your turn and the move is legal
4. **Opponent Disconnected**: Check network connection and server status

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for WebSocket connection logs
- Backend logs show connection status and game events
- Network tab shows WebSocket message traffic

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the multiplayer system:
- [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Game history and replay
- [ ] Spectator mode

- [ ] Move validation on client side
- [ ] Better error recovery

## Dependencies

### Backend
- `fastapi`: Web framework and WebSocket support
- `uvicorn`: ASGI server
- `websockets`: WebSocket testing (optional)

### Frontend
- `react`: UI framework
- `typescript`: Type safety
